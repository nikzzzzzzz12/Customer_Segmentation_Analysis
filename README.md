# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies effectively.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize customer data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Clustering:** Use algorithms like K-Means to segment customers into distinct groups.
- **Visualization:** Employ Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful visual representations.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn. 
```
